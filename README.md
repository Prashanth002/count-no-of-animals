# count-no-of-animals
Using image processing techniques and finding number of animals in the given image  .Here im considering fishes.
since all the objects are of different sizes we need to use morphological image processing to do further reconstruction.As per the image try to use srgb2lab or srgb2xyz to make it work for lumiunent images and so on .
